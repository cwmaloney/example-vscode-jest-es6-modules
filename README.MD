# example-vscode-jest-es6-modules

This project demostrates how to create, run, and debug tests using Visual Studio Code and Jest with ES6 modules.

To uses ES6 modules in Node.js and Jest, requires "experimental" flags for now.
We expect these will not be needed in the future.

To support ES6 modules requires:
* Jest >= 26.0.1
* Node.js >= 12.16.3

## Setup
Download and run:
```
yarn
```
or
```
npm install
```

## To Run Tests

```
yarn test
```

or

```
npm test
```
